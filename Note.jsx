        This was an amazing and great bootcamp taken up by Mr.Shaurya Sinha. We
        covered everything from Scratch including the Javascript React.js and
        HTML. He explained every topic in such a simple way that made all the
        topics easy to understand quickly. The bootcamp was very well organised
        and knowledgeble.
